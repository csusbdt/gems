This is an example Web application that uses Nodejs and PostgrSQL.

The HTML is designed to work with ie8 and higher; [ie7 is not supported](http://theie7countdown.com/).

Videos:

- [Overview](http://youtu.be/ZY9M18nJ7IA)
- [How the client works](http://youtu.be/Ju-Ai55rFAs)
- [How the server works, part 1](http://youtu.be/TuOsxCl_2wo)
- [How the server works, part 2](http://youtu.be/awhe5O_LAUQ)

Note:

The videos are old and rely on CouchDB.  As a result, the code in db.js is completely different.
All other aspects of the code are unchanged except I renamed \_id to id and \_rev to rev.

After recording these videos, I fixed a bug in buy_gem.js.
I also added test_old.sh under scripts to test this bug fix.
