This is an example Web application that uses Nodejs and PostgrSQL.

The HTML is designed to work with ie8 and higher; [ie7 is not supported](http://theie7countdown.com/).

Note:

The following videos are old. After recording these videos,
I changed the database from MongoDB to PostreSQL.
As a result, the code in db.js is completely different.
All other aspects of the code are unchanged except that 
I renamed \_id to id and \_rev to rev.

After recording these videos, I also fixed a bug in buy_gem.js
and added test_old.sh under scripts to test this bug fix.
